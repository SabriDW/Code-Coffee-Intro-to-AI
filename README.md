This repository contains the code and resources for the Introduction to AI talk. In this talk, we cover the basics of AI and its applications.

## Slides
The slides for the talk can be found [here](/Slides.pdf). They provide an overview of the topics discussed during the presentation.

## Opening in Google Colab
To run the code in this repository using Google Colab, click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SabriDW/Code-Coffee-Intro-to-AI/blob/main/MNIST%20Code.ipynb). This will open the repository in a Google Colab notebook, allowing you to execute the code interactively.

## Local Setup
If you prefer to run the code locally, follow the steps below assuming you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/SabriDW/Code-Coffee-Intro-to-AI.git
    cd Code-Coffee-Intro-to-AI
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment using venv:
    ```
    python3 -m venv env
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - For Windows:
      ```
